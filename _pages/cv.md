## Experience

### Master's Project | *September 2025 – Present*

- Performed Monte Carlo simulations to generate 20GB of synthetic training data for time-series prediction. Developed a PyTorch end-to-end pipeline for data generation and ingestion, model training, benchmarking and tuning (Optuna).
- Designed SQL database schema to store and query results from 5000+ ML experiments, enabling systematic comparison of model architectures and hyperparameter configurations across multiple performance metrics (R², MAE, training time).
- Developed deep neural networks (15K+ parameters) that reduced computational time from 48 hours to <30 seconds while achieving R² > 0.98, demonstrating 5000x speedup for iterative what-if analysis.
- Delivered technical presentations to cross-functional audiences of 15+ researchers, translating complex ML model behavior and performance trade-offs into actionable insights for domain experts.

### Data Science Research Intern | *University of Manchester Particle Physics Group* | *June – August 2025*

- Processed and analysed 100GB+ of particle physics data using multithreaded C++ on CERN HPC clusters and reduced data filtering time by ~30%.
- Built automated MLOps pipeline (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for data ingestion, training, and performance tracking, cutting manual workflow time from 3 days to 4 hours and ensuring full reproducibility.
- Designed and trained deep learning models (DNNs and Transformers with 25K–1.6M parameters) for particle mass regression, improving R² from 50% to 85%.
- Authored 30-page technical report and presented findings to 25+ faculty and peers, translating complex ML concepts for mixed audiences.

### Chess Engine | *June – October 2024*

- Developed a competitive chess engine in C++ (ELO 2759, top 230 on global leaderboard) with a 5K-line codebase.
- Optimised search/evaluation algorithms using gradient descent and code profiling, gaining 1000+ ELO and enabling 15 move lookahead in 1 second.
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with unit/integration testing for cross-platform deployment (Windows/Linux), releasing multiple production versions with automated build and deployment workflows.
